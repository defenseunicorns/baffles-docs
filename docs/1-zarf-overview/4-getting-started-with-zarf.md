# Getting Started With Zarf

Depending on how familiar you are with Kubernetes, DevOps, and Zarf, let's find what set of documentation would be most interesting to you!

* If you're still not sure you understand the problem Zarf is trying to solve, it might useful to read through the 'Zarf Core Concepts' section, starting with [What is Kubernets](../zarf-core-concepts/what-is-kubernetes).

* If you want to understand more about what Zarf is 'under the hood' and how the Zarf packages are defined. Following the 'Zarf Basics' is probably best place for you, starting with the [Zarf CLI](../zarf-basics/the-zarf-cli) page.

* If you want to see some practical examples of what Zarf packages can do (and potentially try them out for yourself), the [examples directory](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/tree/master/examples) or the [packages directory](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/tree/master/packages) in the GitHub repo is probaby what you're looking for. Each example within the examples directory contains a set of README instructions for how you can deploy the example yourself.
> Note: The packages in the 'example' directory are for example purposes only. They contain simple configuration that is not representative of a production ready environment. The packages in the 'packages' directory are a lot smaller and are designed be used to support other production packages (such as the init-package that we provide).

* If you're already familiar with Zarf and want to find more information on how to create your own Zarf package, the [Creating Your Own Package](../zarf-advanced/creating-your-own-package) page is exactly what you're looking for.
