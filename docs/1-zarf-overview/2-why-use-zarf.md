# Why Use Zarf?
Most of the software ecosystem assumes your systems have access to the internet. The world (for good reasons) has become more and more dependent upon Software as a Service (SaaS), which assumes a robust connection to the internet and a willingness to inherently trust 3rd party providers. Although this makes sense for most of the world, certain secure systems must operate either fully disconnected, semi-disconnected, or might need the ability to disconnect in case of emergencies (like while under an active cyber attack). Although only a small percentage of systems, these secure systems make up some of the most vital systems globally, such as Aerospace and Defense, Finance, Healthcare, Energy, Water, Sewage, and many Federal, Local, and State Government systems.
